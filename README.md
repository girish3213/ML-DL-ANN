# Artificial Neural Networks: (Regression)


The UCI dataset predicts the net hourly electrical energy output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant. The ML model is built based on the idea of Artificial Neural Networks.

The forward feed takes place with the help of two hidden layers. The backward propagation uses a combo of Gradient and Stochastic gradient descents thereby reducing the loss and increasing the r2_score, a metric used to calculate the accuracy of a regressor model.
